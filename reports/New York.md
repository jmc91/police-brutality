Two police officers shove an unarmed, elderly man ([reportedly 75 years old](https://twitter.com/HannahBuehler/status/1268742666210226177)), who falls backwards and strikes his head on the concrete sidewalk. He appears to begin bleeding from his ear and passes out.

Buffalo P.D. released an official statement saying that he "tripped and fell." They have now opened an investigation into the incident Buffalo Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood has [reportedly](https://twitter.com/HannahBuehler/status/1268732415259955202) ordered the suspension of both officers involved.
